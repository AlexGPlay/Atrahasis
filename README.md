# Atrahasis

Atrahasis is a framework that allows the creation of Java desktop applications in an easier way using MVC and combining the well known frameworks Swing and JavaFX with the web languages HTML, JS and CSS.

## Quickstart
For starting right now I recommend to download the [demo](https://drive.google.com/u/0/uc?id=1ycUIJEUL38gEJzMvD4-m7SFnRydhNh9X&export=download) file and hack through it since I think the basic workarounds aren't too difficult to undestand. If you want to dig more into the framework I recommend to read the How to use.

For more understanding of all the framework I recommend reading the [wiki](https://github.com/AlexGPlay/Atrahasis/wiki).
